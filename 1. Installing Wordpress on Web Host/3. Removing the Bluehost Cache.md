<b>Objective 3: Deactovate cache from Bluehost</b>

<p>Sometimes as you've gone through building the WordPress site, things they're doing in 
  the back end in the WordPress dashboard are not showing up on the frony end and the reason for 
this is that Bluehost installs a cache and we beed to manually remove it if you have it and you
 you want to get rid of it.</p>

 <p>If you go down to setting in your WordPress dashboard:</p>

<p>Scroll to the bottom, you will see this andurance cache:</p>

<p>That is not installed by plugin so we need to disable the endurance cach and the way
to do this is quite simple. You need to log into your Bluehost hosting account and come down
 to the settings tab:</p>

<p>Then fo to the "Advanced" on top menu:</p>

<p>Scroll down to 'cPanel':</p>

<p>When you are in C panel, scroll down to find the file manager under the files section:</p>

<p>And now you are taken into the server space, and the first think to do is to indentify the folder where WordPress is installed and for most people will be down here in the public HTML folder so click on that little icone there:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/322c035b-6573-49dc-b992-d72749446c93)

<hr>
<hr>

<p>Now what we want to change is inside the WP-content folder:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/98af60d7-250c-4fcf-93ad-1d8981586371)

<hr>
<hr>

<p>And you should see the a folder called 'MU Plugins':</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/22c1b036-ba45-42e7-89e8-855b7fa4a786)

<hr>
<hr>

<p>Inside that you will see this andurance page cache:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/4d8c95f5-ea46-49e5-b0fd-98bb851d0e9a)

<hr>

<p>The best way to deactivate it, if we right click on it, click on rename and just take off the PHP extenstion and replace it with "old":</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/e305e063-b8b6-4baf-b265-48abcfab23e3)

<hr>
<hr>

<p>The reason we are doint that, rather than deleting it altogether, is that in the future you may want to use that file again. One it is set to old, go back to your WordPress dashboard where we have no more "Endurance Cache":</p>

<p>So now the cache has been permanently disabled until you are ready to re nable it if ever. Now when you update anythink in the back end in the dashboard, you should find it updated automatically and immediately on the fron end - becouse this was the reason why we deactivated the cache.</p>
