Hi Usman,

I have some good news! I just finished my previous project and created a new repository for your website project. It's called 'WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website-Project,' and you can track my progress on my GitHub account at the following link: www.page.com.

Once I'm ready to insert information, pictures, and the domain, I'll reach out to you. I hope everything goes smoothly, and I'm confident you'll enjoy your new website.

Have a lovely evening, and God bless you.

Best,
[Your Name]
