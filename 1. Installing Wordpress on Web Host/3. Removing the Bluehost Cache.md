<b>Objective 3: Deactovate cache from Bluehost</b>

<p>Sometimes as you've gone through building the WordPress site, things they're doing in 
  the back end in the WordPress dashboard are not showing up on the frony end and the reason for 
this is that Bluehost installs a cache and we beed to manually remove it if you have it and you
 you want to get rid of it.</p>

to do this is quite simple. You need to log into your Bluehost hosting account and come down
 to the settings tab:</p>
