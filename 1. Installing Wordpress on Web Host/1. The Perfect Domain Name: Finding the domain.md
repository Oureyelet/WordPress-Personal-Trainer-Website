<b>Objective : The Perfect Domain Name: Finding the domain</b>

<hr>

<p>As soon as you want your website to be live, you have to have an address where you can send
people and that is where the domain name comes in. Once you've come up with some ideas for domain name,
you need to check if those domains are available and I'm goint to show you great free tool that can
help you do that. Once you found a domain that is available and that you like and you want to use,
it is good idea to check the domain history at the WayBackMachine this will show you snapshots
of that domain in the past so you can see whether it's been used for anything that you wouldn's want
to be associated with becouse you want to avoid domain that have a shady history.</p>

<p>The tool itself is called Domain Name Analyzer. And let go over the Google and find it:</p>

<p>You can see some are available as we would expectet them to be so the next step is you remember is just to go and check to make sure it has not had a shady past and we do that at the WayBackMachine under https://archive.org/:</p>
