<b>Objective 2: Installing WordPress on a web host using the domain</b>

<p>Web Host - This is the company that rents you disk space on their computers 
(servers). You can use that disk space to install your website. When someone visits 
your website, it's delivered from that web host. The web host has a unique DNS 
which you give to your registrar</p>

<p>DNS - DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's a system that converts domain 
names into numeric IP addresses. See also Registrar and web host.
</p>

<p>IP address - This is a unique string of numbers and full stops (periods) that uniquely 
identify a computer on the internet.</p>
