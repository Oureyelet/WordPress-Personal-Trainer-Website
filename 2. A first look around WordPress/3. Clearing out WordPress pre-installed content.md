<b>Objective: We are goint to have a look at some of the stuff that WordPress preinstalled and 
clear it out so we have a genuine blank canvas to start building our own website.</b>

Let's go into the dashboard and see what WordPress did and how we can remove some of this dummy content.

Let's go first to the "pages", and I'm goint to see that sample page by clicking this "All Pages" link:

And you can see WordPress has created a privacy policy which is labeled as draft - that;s mean is not live on the webside and the sample page:

There is also the sample page I want to delete by clicking on "Trash":

And that will send that page to the trash so we can see now I have one item in trash:

If I go to my page and refresh, you can see that sample page link up there has now disappeared:

Now we can move on the "Posts" Posts and pages are two diffrent ways of creating web pages on WordPress so if I click "Posts" we can see all the posts we've got here:

Let's delete the post "Hello World":

If you back to the front end, you can see  that we've got some things here, we've got for example search box those are added by something called widgets:

You can access the widgets through the appearance menu go down to widgets:
