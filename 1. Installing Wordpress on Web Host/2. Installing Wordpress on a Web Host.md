<b>Objective 2: Installing WordPress on a web host using the domain</b>

<p>Web Host - This is the company that rents you disk space on their computers 
(servers). You can use that disk space to install your website. When someone visits 
your website, it's delivered from that web host. The web host has a unique DNS 
which you give to your registrar</p>

<p>DNS - DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's a system that converts domain 
names into numeric IP addresses. See also Registrar and web host.
</p>

<p>IP address - This is a unique string of numbers and full stops (periods) that uniquely 
identify a computer on the internet.</p>

<hr>

<p>We hane not told www.namecheap.com that we are using bluehost so we need to do that. Click on this 'bluehost account' button that will take you into your Bluehost hosting:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/03bf09e1-9a6d-452d-bd7e-4102c8a130c2)

<hr>

<p>Then scroll down, and you see at the bottom "Server information" you need those so copy those and then go over and log into your Namecheap account:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/b56d8bb2-70aa-4500-a635-28a0b5479ba2)

<hr>

<p>Once you logged in into Nnamecheap account you should find your domain and come across to the 'Manage' button over the right:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/db056281-cfcf-4dc2-a93d-05fd6e8974f8)

<hr>

<p>And when that loads up, if you scroll down to where it says "Name Servers" and at this moment is says "Namecheap Basic DNS" so drop that box down and select "Custom DNS":</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/cdbd54e6-8316-4d2b-8597-8362e2ff607f)

<hr>

<p>The next step that you need to do is go across to 'Users':</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/2bf2b117-0ed5-415f-955d-4eb5fdf0fc7d)

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/c1b1de2d-7afc-4fc8-a59d-6a42203632e4)

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/882ffe01-6fc8-4cf6-ba28-b4659b1d358a)

<hr>

<p>Make sure your new user is safe as a "Administrator" not "Subscriber" if not go to 'Edit':</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/cdad59a6-6fd7-484f-896a-16c320c80aac)

<hr>

<p>And under "Role" change to 'Administrator'</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/5e18d3e0-6104-4543-85cd-8639d58a0d77)

<hr>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/c8ab6306-c931-453f-90f3-afbd10c78589)

<hr>

<p>No we can go in and edit the site now:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/6e46418b-7abc-4f54-a357-41e2d7051b9b)

<hr>

<p>I do not recoment you every time you want to access our dashboard so another way to log into your dashboard is to use your domain name + pw-admin (https://usmanuzziaslam.net/wp-admin/) and now we can use our new user and password we safed:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/4ae02da0-5741-4518-bdf0-874df9a259c9)

<hr>

<p>And I'm now inside my dashboard for usmanuzziaslam.net:/</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/25a8877c-416c-4498-9698-43e68b53bba6)

<hr>

<p>From way I've been learn to work on WordPress I like to start with clean slate so go to Plugins and Installed:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/c6c79199-3431-42c3-bf5b-2060d152105e)

<hr>

<p>I'm goint to select all the plugins, (unselect the Blue host becouse I want to keep it):</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/e6967c39-1eaf-4ee5-b664-8f8e21dca566)

<hr>

<p>And then under drop-down menu select "Deactivate":</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/eb9a172a-41c1-4760-8bf2-e62f21e02da9)

<hr>

<p>I would just say that any plugins that you deactivate, you should delete them from the dashboard. They can end up being security threats if they don't get updated so go to "Inactive":</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/6c6fa661-e4a8-4c8f-a957-625bb7ce472e)

<hr>

<p>Select all and from drop-down menu delete them:</p>

![image](https://github.com/Oureyelet/WordPress-Personal-Trainer-Website/assets/69697624/7a87842b-44c8-47db-986f-3e5168a06e94)

<hr>

<p>That is WordPress installed on my domain using Namecheap as the registrar.</p>
